The SPARC lab welcomes motivated individuals interested in space structures and robotic construction.  Given the interdisciplinary nature of our research, we are recruiting Masters students, Ph.D. students, and postdoctoral scholars with backgrounds in mechanics, dynamics and control, robotics, and related fields. Please note that the SPARC lab will officially launch in Fall 2026, but we welcome early inquiries from motivated candidates interested in joining the team.

<u>Current UMD students:</u>
If you are a current undergraduate, M.S., or Ph.D. student, please reach out to Prof. Bhundiya directly with your resume/CV, previous coursework and research experience, and a description of your interest in the lab (e.g., any previous projects/papers that piqued your interest).

<u>Prospective students/postdocs:</u>
If you are a prospective M.S. or Ph.D. student, please apply to the UMD Aerospace Engineering graduate program by the December 1st priority deadline and mention your interest in joining SPARC lab in your application. See [here](https://aero.umd.edu/graduate/prospective-students/admissions) for additional information regarding the application and [here](https://gradschool.umd.edu/funding/assistantship-information/stipend-memo) for the current graduate student stipend rates. After your application, interviews will begin around January/February, and graduate research assistantship (GRA) offers will be sent around March. If you are a prospective postdoctoral scholar, please reach out directly to Prof. Bhundiya with your CV, a description of your previous research, how your research interests align with SPARC lab, and a tentative timeline of your future plans.

<u>Additional information for prospective Ph.D. students:</u>
My goal as an advisor is to produce high-quality research while providing the care and support students need to become independent scholars. I hope to develop a [mentor mindset](https://joshbrake.substack.com/p/the-mentor-mindset) balancing high expectations with high support. To that end, each student will have weekly 1:1 meetings to discuss progress and feedback, as well as weekly group meetings to share updates with other lab members. The group meetings will also focus on developing vital research skills, such as effective technical communication for posters, papers, and presentations. At the start of each semester, we will hold individual goals meetings to discuss expectations, milestones, and potential roadblocks. Ultimately, I hope joining SPARC lab will be a stepping stone to great career, and I am eager to help guide and mentor students on their paths.

<u>Prospective collaborators:</u>
The SPARC lab plans to collaborate with many academic, governmental, and commercial entities through research grants. As part of the UMD [Center for Advanced Space Science and Technology Research](https://astra.umd.edu/) (ASTRA), we plan to establish long-term collaborations with Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center. We are also interested in pursuing industry-sponsored research grants and conducting space demonstrations through hosted payloads and rideshare missions. Please send an email to Prof. Bhundiya expressing your interests and we will work towards a fruitful collaboration.
