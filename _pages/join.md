The SPARC lab welcomes motivated individuals interested in space structures and robotic construction. Currently we are recruiting M.S. students, Ph.D. students, and postdoctoral scholars with backgrounds in mechanics, dynamics and control, robotics, and related fields. Please note that the SPARC lab will officially launch in Fall 2026, but we welcome early inquiries.

**Mentoring philosophy:**

My goal as an advisor is to produce high-quality research while providing the care and support students need to become independent scholars. I hope to develop a [mentor mindset](https://joshbrake.substack.com/p/the-mentor-mindset) balancing high expectations with high support. I plan to have regular 1:1 meetings with each student to discuss progress and feedback, as well as weekly group meetings to share updates. During group meetings, we will develop vital research skills such as effective technical communication for posters, papers, and presentations. At the start of each semester, we will also hold individual goals meetings to discuss expectations, milestones, and potential roadblocks. Ultimately, I hope joining SPARC lab will be a stepping stone to great career, and I am eager to help guide and mentor students on their paths.

<u>Current UMD undergraduate students,</u> please email Prof. Bhundiya with your resume/CV and a description of your specific interests in the lab (e.g., any previous projects/papers that piqued your interest). Please include [SPARC-APPLY] in the subject line.

<u>Prospective M.S./Ph.D. students</u>, please apply to the UMD Aerospace Engineering graduate program by the December 1st priority deadline and mention your interest in joining SPARC lab in your application.

<u>Prospective postdocoral scholars</u>, please directly email Prof. Bhundiya with your CV, a description of your previous research, how your interests align with SPARC lab, and a tentative timeline of your future plans.


**Prospective collaborators:**

The SPARC lab plans to collaborate with many academic, governmental, and commercial entities through research grants. As part of the UMD [Center for Advanced Space Science and Technology Research](https://astra.umd.edu/) (ASTRA), we plan to establish long-term collaborations with Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center. We are also interested in pursuing industry-sponsored research grants and conducting space demonstrations through hosted payloads and rideshare missions. Please email Prof. Bhundiya expressing your interests and we will work towards a fruitful collaboration.
