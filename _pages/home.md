Welcome!

The Space Structures and Robotic Construction (SPARC) Lab conducts interdisciplinary research at the intersection of mechanics, dynamics, and robotics. Our vision is to develop mass-efficient structures and robotic construction systems for applications including large space telescopes, high-power communication systems, and habitats on the Moon and Mars. Our current research interests include: 1) efficient mission design for in-space assembly and manufacturing, 2) low-power robotic construction, and 3) spacecraft attitude control. The SPARC lab is led by Prof. Harsh Bhundiya in the [Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Maryland](https://aero.umd.edu/).

The SPARC Lab is actively hiring students and postdocs and will officially launch at UMD in Fall 2026. Please visit here to learn how to join the lab.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
