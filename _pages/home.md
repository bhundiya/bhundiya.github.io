Welcome!

The Space Structures and Robotic Construction (SPARC) Lab conducts interdisciplinary research at the intersection of **mechanics**, **dynamics**, and **robotics**. Our vision is to develop mass-efficient structures and robotic construction systems for applications including large space telescopes, high-power communication systems, and habitats on the Moon and Mars. Our current research interests include: 1) efficient mission design for in-space assembly and manufacturing, 2) low-power robotic construction, and 3) spacecraft attitude control. The SPARC lab is led by [Prof. Harsh Bhundiya](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1wCSzO0AAAAJ&hl=en) in the [Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Maryland](https://aero.umd.edu/).

The SPARC Lab is actively hiring students and postdocs and will officially launch at UMD in Fall 2026. Please visit [here]('/team') to learn how to join the lab.
