To enable the scalable construction of large structures with compact robotic systems, the SPARC Lab develops low-power construction methods for mass-efficient structures. We are also interested in developing multi-agent construction systems with efficient task coordination and planning.

One construction approached developed by SPARC lab, Bend-Forming, combines CNC wire bending with mechanical joints to fabricate load-bearing truss structures from spooled ductile feedstock. Bend-Forming can fabricate complex truss geometries including isogrid columns, curved gridshells, and tetrahedral trusses {% cite bhundiya2022compressive bhundiya2023bend %}. Integrating Bend-Forming with electrostatic actuation also enables smart structures and novel applications, such as electrostatically-actuated communication antennas {% cite zhang2024electrostatically %}.
